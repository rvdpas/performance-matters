# Performance Matters Funda application

## Introduction
In this repository, you will find code to optimize the Funda Web Application. Funda is the largest real estate platform for Consumers and entrepreneurs. The company has a huge database with all the houses that are available for sale in the Netherlands. Through the uses of multiple techniques, I'll improve the speed of the application. I've learned a few of these techniques during the class Performance Matters at the HvA during the Minor Web Development.
